# DriversLicenseParser
Drivers licenses in the USA are all over the map and there are some sugestions that states follow but not all of them. How do you handle these differences? You could write and maintain this on your own or use an API that can parse the data from the bar code. If you want to do the former then feel free to copy this code, it is offered as is. If you want to use an API you can see the blow documentation on how to do that.
